# Numeric Operations
print( 5+3 )
print( 5-3 )
print( 5*3 )
print( 5/3 )    # always floating point division
print( 5**3 )   # to the power of 
print( 5//3 )   # division with the result truncated to int
print( 5%3 )
print( 5%3.1 )  # the reminder works for floating point as well

# Note: there are two additional class-based numerical data types: Decimal and Fraction

print( -5**2 )          # obvious but reminded just in case ;-)
print( (-5)**2 )
print( (1j * 1j) )      # complex numbers are here
print( round(5/3, 4) )  # rounds a floating point number to n decimal digits
